                         Songwrite 2

    A tablature and music score editor.


Songwrite 2 is a music score and songbook editor. This software is
especially designed for musicians who do not master solfege (like me!)
and to Linuxian musicians. Songwrite 2 can edit staffs, but also
tablatures (for guitar, bass, banjo, lyre and diatonic accordion,...)
and flute fingerings (for tin whistle, recorder,...); it also manages
lyrics. Songwrite 2 can play and print the partitions.

Songwrite 2 is a free software (libre software) written in Python. It
is available under GNU GPL.
